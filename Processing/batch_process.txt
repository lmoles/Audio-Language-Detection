This line will process all .mp3 files in a directory into .wav format for easy reading and processing in python.
It works for PowerShell if ffmpeg is in path and your cd is the location of the files.


ls | Where { $_.Extension -eq ".mp3" } | ForEach { ffmpeg -i $_.FullName $_.Name.Replace(".mp3", ".wav") }
